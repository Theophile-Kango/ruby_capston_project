# TELEGRAM BOT FOR COVID-19

## Introduction

These days every one want to get information about coronavirus. It's really on top. Every one want to know the evolution of the situation. As it very hard every time to open the browser and look for the website to get informed, I thought it can be helpfull to build a bot that can help the user to get corona information.

## Prerequisites

I have two version of this app

- Install telegram app in your divice (mobile phone, descktop or tablette) to run the bot
- Get ruby latest version installed (To use test the code in your environment)

### How to install telegram

- And a test editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Ressources

- Information comes from [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)

    An example is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3CLEUBdWwQ&t=1435s)
